# Websockets
WebSockets are widely used in modern web applications. They are initiated over HTTP and provide long-lived connections with asynchronous communication in both directions.
WebSockets are used for all kinds of purposes, including performing user actions and transmitting sensitive information. Virtually any web security vulnerability that arises with regular HTTP can also arise in relation to WebSockets communications.
## Manipulating WebSocket traffic
- Intercept and modify WebSocket messages.
- Replay and generate new WebSocket messages.
- Manipulate WebSocket connections.

- In Burp Client-Server connection checking
          - Client to Server: PING
          - Server to Client: PONG

- There are various situations in which manipulating the WebSocket handshake might be necessary:
    1. It can enable you to reach more attack surface.
    2.Some attacks might cause your connection to drop so you need to establish a new one.
    3.Tokens or other data in the original handshake request might be stale and need updating.
