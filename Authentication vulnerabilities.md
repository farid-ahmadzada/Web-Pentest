# What is Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.
- There are three main types of authentication:
    - Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
    - Something you have, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
    - Something you are or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

## Difference between authentication and authorization
- Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.
- Authentication user:pass login
- Authorization your permission, access, rights

## Auth Vulnerabilities Occur :
- Fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called "broken authentication".

# Vulnerabilities in password-based login

## While Brute-F ing 
- Pay Attention
    - **Status Codes:**
    - **Error messages:**
    - **Response times:**

## Bypass **IP-based brute-force protection** by manipulating HTTP request headers.
```
HTTP ...
...
X-Forwarded-For $change-number-every-request$
...
```
## Flawed brute-force protection
- Common ways to protect BF
    - Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access if they make too many failed login attempts
    - Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many login attempts in quick succession

 - **In some implementations, the counter for the number of failed attempts resets if the IP owner logs in successfully.*

## Account Locking
- 1. Try Unregistered User : alice 100 time with diff pass -> "Incorrext password or User"
  2. Try Registered User : bob 100 time with diff pass -> "You have made too many incorrect login attempts."
- In this way you can identify some usernames

## User Rate Limiting
- IP unblocked ways
    - Automatically after a certain period of time
    - Manually by an administrator
    - Manually by the user after successfully completing a CAPTCHA
