# What is Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.
- There are three main types of authentication:
    - Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
    - Something you have, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
    - Something you are or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

## Difference between authentication and authorization
- Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.
- Authentication user:pass login
